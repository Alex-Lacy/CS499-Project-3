Our Neural Network algorithm can be found here: [NNetOneSplit](https://github.com/Alex-Lacy/CS499-Project-3/blob/master/Project%203.py)

This time, our algorithm and driver code are packaged into the same file.

Our algorithm is designed to only work on single sets of binary classification data.  For our results, we used [Stanford's Spam Data](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/data.html) for our data. 

In order to use our code effecitvely, please be sure you have the data file in the same directory as the driver function, and be sure to import it in the code.

You can adjust the number of epochs freely, our default is 300.

That's it! Run the code and watch the algorithm work!
